	<p>Hello to anyone who is reading this, hopefully you're having a nice day regardless of what's going on in the world right now -<i>stay safe</i>-.<br> My name is <i>Rei Canodemaj</i> and I am a foreign student from Albania. This website started as an assignment but it became more than that, I actually had a lot of fun building this. Some things I could have done better, I know there are a lot of bugs and things don't work the way they should but I really hope you like it. <br>Sincerely,<br>Rei Canodemaj</p>
